## User Experience (UX) [https://github.com/AndrewH1188/go-tennis-ms1/blob/4b710aba74ed014f6e76951f08a83a3a476f35ff/README.md#ux]
I have designed this website for my Tennis coach Adam Jameel who is starting up his own business. 
This website is to allow users to have video lessons and tutorials wherever they are in the world. 
This has been bought about because of the current pandemic and my Tennis coach wanting to keep people fit, training as well as keep their physical and mental health on form.

### User stories [https://github.com/AndrewH1188/go-tennis-ms1/blob/4b710aba74ed014f6e76951f08a83a3a476f35ff/README.md#user-stories]

    1.  As a new / first time user / potential customer I would like users to learn more about the organisation, as well as easily understand the goals that this site is offering.
    2.  As a new / first time user / potential customer all content will be easy to navigate through in order that the user finds what they are looking for quickly, this will provide the user with a great friendly user experience and transform them into a returning and frequent user of the site.
    3. As part of the new / first time user’s / potential customer's experience there will be all the information such as customer feedback in the way of testimonials. This is to help them make an informed decision about the service that Go Tennis System has offered, and can offer you. There will also be social media links so you can follow Go Tennis System and see their new  posts, as well as provide another form of interaction to the user and Go Tennis System.

As a new / first time user / potential customer I would expect the questions that they would ask are:
	1. What will I receive?
	2. Why should I use Go Tennis System?
	3. What does this site have to offer me?
	4. How do I receive the coaching / feedback?
	5. How much is the coaching / feedback service?
	6. Is this unique to me?
	7. How do I do the shot / how can I perfect my shot
	8. How do I do something that isn’t how everyone else does it, for example how can I be  unique?
	9. Does this service offer coaching to suit me at my level and can I progress?

#### Returning Visitor Goals [https://github.com/AndrewH1188/go-tennis-ms1/blob/4b710aba74ed014f6e76951f08a83a3a476f35ff/README.md#returning-visitor-goals]

	1. As a returning user / customer I would like to be able to see updated relevant content.
	2. As a returning user / customer I would like to find the relevant information that helps me progress as well as any offers that may be available for me to take advantage of.
	3.	As a returning user / customer I would like to be able to have the content delivered in a way that is easily understandable and relatable to me and what I am looking for.

As a returning user / customer I would expect the questions that they would ask are:
    1. Is the content being refreshed / new content being added / updated?
	2. Are there any discounts or offers that I may be able to use / take advantage of?
	3. How do I perfect my shots from my current standard?
	4. Is the information relatable and understandable?

#### Frequent User Goals [https://github.com/AndrewH1188/go-tennis-ms1/blob/4b710aba74ed014f6e76951f08a83a3a476f35ff/README.md#frequent-visitor-goals]

		1. As a frequent user / customer I would like to be able to see relevant updated content 
		2. As a frequent user / customer I would like to be able to see where there are events taking place near me that I may be interested in and like to go and join in with. In doing so this will enable me to put into practice what I have learned and also learn through playing others too.
		3. As a frequent user / customer I would like to be able to see items that will get me involved with Go Tennis System, a few examples maybe meet up events, one on one with my coach, pairing me with someone else of maybe the same standard or slightly better, in doing this it will enable me as the user of the Go Tennis System to really feel a part of this, and also put my skills to the test. I would also like to see other such customer focused activities that will help me in my player development. Other things to be included could be email newsletters with Top Tips, Tricks and Training guides and exercises to help me before and after my  session(s).

    As a frequent user I would expect the questions that they would ask are:
		1. How can I go from my current standard to the next / advance?
		2. What new tips, tricks, tactics and ways  are there to implement what I have learned?
		3. Are there any strategies for games?
		4. How do I perfect my shots from my current standard that I’m at to maybe / be able to go on and compete socially or in tournaments?

		I would expect the bulk of new, returning and frequent users to be at a beginner level, although would say that there will be users that have been playing that are not beginners and want to learn more, as well as perfect what they have already learned / know.


#### User/Customer Goals [https://github.com/AndrewH1188/go-tennis-ms1/blob/4b710aba74ed014f6e76951f08a83a3a476f35ff/README.md#customer-goals]

The user/customer goals that Go Tennis System will offer to provide to users are:

    1. As part of the ability to upload/submit their video the user/customer will be asked for a donation. Part of this will go to a dogs charity or an animal rescue that members of Go Tennis System are associated with. Part of the donation will go to help with running costs of the site as well as pay for the assessors time and knowledge.
    2. The ability to upload/submit the users footage: Upon having contributed a donation the user/customer will receive a focused, helpful service by means of coaching to enable them to improve their skills by the assessor. Video footage as well as tips, tricks and training will help the user to enhance their shots, increase their understanding and fine tune their skills. 
    3. This service is online only, this will enable users/customers the ability to receive feedback whatever the current outlook of the world, or wherever in the world they are located. Also in doing the training online this allows the user to take the training at their own pace, practice anywhere they are able to do so, as well as at a time to suit them.
    4. By using the Go Tennis System video uploading service users/customers are able to form their own video diary of their progress. They will be able to watch the video feedback and coaching they receive and document their journey from the day they started out to the level they want to be at. There is hope that the user/customer will continue to take advantage of offers and USPs (Unique Selling Points) enabling them to train more so that should the customer/user wish to this will enable them to compete socially as well as in matches/tournaments. 

#### User/Customer Goals [https://github.com/AndrewH1188/go-tennis-ms1/blob/4b710aba74ed014f6e76951f08a83a3a476f35ff/README.md#business-goals]

The business goals and outcomes that Go Tennis System want to receive from this website are:

    1. Reaching out to new users/customers in having another platform (the website) in which users will be able to find them.
    2. In having the website have the users/customers interact with this by means of uploading their videos for coaching/assessment.
    3. Retain customers through USP (Unique Selling Points) and offers that make Go Tennis the go to place for this kind of service. To go on and add a subscription service to give users/customers the sense of commitment and to retain them too. Yes ok you could watch YouTube videos, but most often these steps are not relevant to the player watching, the reason is the player watching will want to play their way, a way that is comfortable and controllable to them (at the start, as playing matches/tournaments users will be expected to play to the standard of the other player if not better, if they are to really compete).
    4. By providing coaching at your level and pace this will help with confidence for the  users/customers, meaning they will interact with the site more often as they seek to improve and learn, this will give the website stable traffic to start with but over time the more users, the more the business can grow.


### Design

The site is designed over three pages although has four links. There is the index which also houses the about section, uploads and contact pages which are stand alone.
The links all work and connect to the relevant page or section of the project.

The font that I have used for the pages is Montserrat for all headings and body text. I have used Meedori Sans for the logo that I produced in Adobe Illustrator [https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/illustrator.html].
I chose the colours based on the brief I was given by Adam my Tennis Coach as he likes blue and orange
